Data for Animals will maintain a monthly newsletter in a similar format to the highly-regarded [Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/) newsletter. The goal of this newsletter would be as follows:

1. **Keep stakeholders informed** \- The newsletter will provide regular updates on Data for Animals’ activities, including the release of new datasets, enhancements to existing ones, and key organizational initiatives.  
2. **Disseminate local knowledge** \- The newsletter will highlight lesser-known datasets, tools, and resources that advocates can leverage to enhance their impact.  
3. **Feature success stories and case studies** \- The newsletter will showcase real-world examples of how individuals and organizations have creatively leveraged data to advance their goals and achieve outsized impact. These stories would provide inspiration and practical lessons to advocates interested in leveraging data in their work.

The newsletter would be disseminated through email and social media channels, such as X, Mastodon, and Bluesky.

## **Value Capture** {#value-capture}
